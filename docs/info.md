## How it works

Hidden in the logic are the numbers 0-9! Flip different combinations of dip switches to find the numbers 0-9. When the a correct combination is found, a number will display on the 7-segment display. If no number is shown (or the red dot on the bottom right is lit) then you have not found a valid combination. Combinations may be 1 to 8 digits long...all the dip...all the switch! 

## How to test

No Clue

## External hardware

To be used with the Tiny Tapeout project PCB. Dip switches and 7-segment display are on TT-PCB.
